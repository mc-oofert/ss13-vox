                    HTS Voices for Festival
                   release December 26, 2003
                                
Two HTS voices for Festival trained by using 450 utterances of
"CSTR US KED Timit" (http://www.festvox.org/dbs/dbs_kdt.html)
and 523 utterances of "CMU Communicator KAL limited domain"
(http://www.festvox.org/dbs/dbs_com.html), respectively, and
four HTS voices for Festival trained by using "CMU ARCTIC
database" (http://www.festvox.org/cmu_arctic/) are released as a
part of HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) version 1.1.1
(http://hts.ics.nitech.ac.jp/).  Each of HTS voices consists of
HMMs trained by using HTS and a small run-time synthesis engine,
and can be used as a "voice" of Festival Speech Synthesis System
(http://www.festvox.org/festival/) without any other HTS tools.

                          Installation
****************************************************************

*** Installation of HTS Voice ***

(cmu_us_bdl_arctic_hts.tar.gz, cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts.tar.gz,
cmu_us_jmk_arctic_hts.tar.gz, cmu_us_awb_arctic_hts.tar.gz, and
cmu_us_kal_com_hts.tar.gz can also be used in the same manner.)

 0) Download "cstr_us_ked_timit_hts.tar.gz" from
    http://hts.ics.nitech.ac.jp/ and expand it in the directory
    which you installed the Festival.

Note:

The small run-time synthesis engine is in a form of Linux-i386
binary.  If you are working on another platform, please
re-compile it based on the source code included in
"HTS-1.1.1_for_HTK-3.2.1.tar.gz."

*** test ***

 0) Run Festival

 1) To change the current voice, type:

    festival> (voice_cstr_us_ked_timit_hts)

 2) Now you can synthesize speech using the HTS voice in the
    framework of Festival.  See the manual of Festival.

    Example:

      festival > (intro)

      festival > (SayText "Alice was beginning to get tired.")

*** Changing Voice Characteristics ***

You can change the voice characteristics, F0 parameter, and
speaking rate by modifying the values of the following
variables.

1. Vocal tract length: hts_fw_factor
      Default: 0.42
      Recommended range: 0.2 < hts_fw_factor < 0.6

   Example: 
     festival> (set! hts_fw_factor 0.1)

2. F0 variation factor: hts_f0_std 1.0
      Default: 1.0
      Recommended range: 0.0 < hts_f0_std < 10

   Example:
     festival> (set! hts_f0_std 2)

3. F0 shift: hts_f0_mean
      Default: 0.0

   Example:
     festival > (set! hts_f0_mean 0)

4. Speaking rate: hts_duration_stretch
      Default: 0.0
      Recommended range: -0.5 (fast) < hts_duration_stretch < 0.5 (slow)

   Example:
     festival > (set! hts_duration_stretch 0.1)

5. Utterance length (second): hts_total_length
      Default: None

   Example:
     festival > set! hts_total_length 10.0

6. Voiced/Unvoiced threshold: hts_uv_threshold
      Default: 0.5

   Example:
     festival > set! hts_uv_threshold 0.8

7. Strength of postfiltering: hts_postfilter
      Default: 0.3
      Recommended range: 0 (without postfilter) < hts_postfilter < 0.8

   Example:
     festival > (set! hts_uv_threshold 0.6)

8. Using phoneme durations estimated by Festival: hts_use_phone_align
      Default: 0

   Example:
     festival> (set! hts_use_phone_align 1)
